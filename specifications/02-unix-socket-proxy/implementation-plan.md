# Unix Domain Socket Proxy CLI Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implementing a simple Unix domain socket proxy CLI tool that creates a proxy socket and forwards messages to a target socket, with the ability to intercept and process messages for either forwarding or internal responses. Built with JavaScript and Bun, following existing patterns from the codebase.

## Current State Analysis

### Key Discoveries:
- Existing robust Unix socket transport at `packages/rpc/src/transports/unix-socket-transport.ts:1-173` using `Bun.connect()` API
- Message processing patterns using newline-delimited messages and proper buffering

### Constraints:
- Must use Bun instead of Node.js (per CLAUDE.md)
- Follow existing socket patterns with newline delimiters
- macOS socket path limit of 104 characters
- Should integrate well with existing RPC infrastructure

## What We're NOT Doing

- Complex configuration systems or DSLs
- Protocol-specific parsing (staying format agnostic)
- GUI or web interface
- Database persistence
- Advanced routing algorithms
- Multi-target forwarding

## Implementation Approach

Create a simple CLI tool that acts as a Unix domain socket proxy, using established patterns from the codebase. The proxy will:
1. Create a server socket at the specified proxy path
2. Accept client connections
3. For each message, either forward to target socket or respond internally
4. Use simple message inspection for routing decisions

## Phase 1: Core Proxy Infrastructure

### Overview
Establish the basic proxy server with socket creation, client connection handling, and target socket forwarding.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Package Structure
**Directory**: `packages/unix-socket-proxy/`
**Changes**: Create new package with standard structure

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Initialize package with `package.json` following workspace patterns
- Set up TypeScript configuration matching other packages
- Create source directory structure (`src/`, `test/`)
- Include CLI entry point configuration
- Add Bun-specific runtime configurations
- Set up development scripts for local testing

#### 2. Core Proxy Server
**File**: `packages/unix-socket-proxy/src/proxy-server.ts`
**Changes**: Implement Unix domain socket proxy server

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create proxy server class that binds to specified socket path
- Accept multiple concurrent client connections using node.js socket APIs through bun (`node:net`)
- Implement per-connection message handling with proper buffering
- Use newline-delimited message boundaries matching existing patterns
- Handle client connection lifecycle (open, data, close, error)
- Support graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup
- Include structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Handle socket path permissions and stale socket cleanup

#### 3. Target Socket Client
**File**: `packages/unix-socket-proxy/src/target-client.ts`
**Changes**: Implement client for connecting to target socket

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create client class that connects to target Unix domain socket
- Implement connection pooling or connection reuse strategies
- Handle target socket unavailability and reconnection logic
- Support message queuing when target is temporarily unavailable
- Include proper error handling and timeout management
- Implement connection lifecycle management matching existing transport patterns

#### 4. Message Router
**File**: `packages/unix-socket-proxy/src/message-router.ts`
**Changes**: Implement message routing logic

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create router interface for forwarding vs internal response decisions
- Implement simple pattern matching for message inspection: `shouldForward(message: string) => boolean`, `rules: Array<(message: string) => boolean>`
- Provide default "forward all" behavior for simplicity
- Include message transformation capabilities for internal responses
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous routing decisions
- Add logging for routing decisions to aid in debugging
- Handle malformed or incomplete message gracefully

### Success Criteria:

**Automated verification**
- [ ] `bun test` passes all unit tests


**Manual Verification**
- [ ] Proxy server starts and binds to specified socket path
- [ ] Client connections are accepted and handled properly
- [ ] Messages are successfully forwarded to target socket
- [ ] Responses from target are forwarded back to clients
- [ ] Proxy handles multiple concurrent connections
- [ ] Graceful shutdown works without hanging connections

## Phase 2: CLI Interface and Configuration

### Overview
Add command-line interface with argument parsing, configuration options, and operational features.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. CLI Entry Point
**File**: `packages/unix-socket-proxy/src/cli.ts`
**Changes**: Create CLI interface with argument parsing

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Parse command line arguments for proxy socket path and target socket path
- Support optional configuration for routing behavior
- Include debug logging flag and verbosity levels
- Implement help text and usage examples
- Add validation for socket paths and configuration
- Support environment variable overrides following existing patterns
- Include version information and about text
- Handle CLI errors gracefully with proper exit codes

#### 2. Configuration System
**File**: `packages/unix-socket-proxy/src/config.ts`
**Changes**: Implement simple configuration management

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Define configuration interface for routing rules and proxy behavior
- Support JSON configuration file loading (optional)
- Provide sensible defaults for all configuration options
- Include validation using Zod schemas matching existing patterns
- Support runtime configuration updates for debugging
- Add configuration merging from CLI args, environment, and files
- Include configuration documentation and examples
- Handle configuration errors with clear error messages

#### 3. Executable Setup
**File**: `packages/unix-socket-proxy/package.json`
**Changes**: Configure package as CLI tool

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Add bin entry pointing to CLI script
- Configure TypeScript compilation for executable
- Set up proper dependencies and peer dependencies
- Include scripts for building and installing CLI
- Add package metadata and description
- Configure exports for both CLI and library usage
- Set up bundling if needed for standalone distribution

### Success Criteria:

**Automated verification**
- [ ] `bun test` passes all tests including CLI tests
- [ ] `bun run typecheck` shows no errors
- [ ] CLI executable can be run with `bun run cli` or similar

**Manual Verification**
- [ ] CLI displays help when run with --help
- [ ] CLI validates required arguments (proxy path, target path)
- [ ] CLI starts proxy server with specified configuration
- [ ] Debug logging works when enabled
- [ ] Configuration file loading works correctly
- [ ] CLI handles invalid arguments gracefully

## Phase 3: Internal Response Logic and Testing

### Overview
Implement internal response capabilities, comprehensive testing, and operational utilities.

### Changes Required:

- Implement common debugging responses (echo, status, health check)
- Add message inspection utilities for routing decisions
- Support both text and JSON response formats
- Include response timing and metadata injection
- Add response caching for frequently requested internal data
- Handle response generation errors gracefully

#### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite
