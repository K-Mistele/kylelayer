# Simple HTTP Proxy Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement a simple HTTP proxy server using JavaScript and Bun that can listen on a configurable local port, forward requests to a configurable target host/port, and optionally process messages with custom logic before forwarding or replying directly.

## Current State Analysis


### Key Discoveries:
- **Bun Integration**: All packages use Bun runtime with `Bun.serve()` pattern expected
- **Package Structure**: Follows monorepo workspace pattern with `@kylelayer/*` scoping
- **Testing Framework**: Uses `bun:test` with comprehensive test coverage patterns

### Pattern to Follow:
- Use `Bun.serve()` for HTTP server implementation (following CLAUDE.md directives)
- Implement package structure matching existing packages (`packages/rpc/`, `packages/protocol/`) at `packages/http-server-proxy`

### Technical Constraints Discovered:
- Must use Bun instead of Node.js/Express (per CLAUDE.md)
- Must include comprehensive error handling and timeout management

## What We're NOT Doing

- Not creating a full-featured reverse proxy (like nginx)
- Not implementing load balancing or advanced routing
- Not adding authentication/authorization features initially
- Not creating a web UI or management interface
- Not implementing caching or request/response transformation beyond basic message processing
- Not supporting HTTPS/TLS termination initially
- Not implementing WebSocket proxying in the first version

## Implementation Approach

Create a minimal, focused HTTP proxy that can:
1. Accept configuration for local port and target host/port
2. Forward HTTP requests to target server
3. Allow custom message processing logic to intercept and modify or reply to requests
4. Handle errors gracefully with proper timeout management
5. Provide basic logging and health check endpoints

The implementation will follow the established Bun server patterns and integrate cleanly with the existing codebase structure.

## Phase 1: Core Proxy Infrastructure

### Overview
Establish the basic package structure, configuration system, and core HTTP proxy functionality using Bun.serve().

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Core Proxy Server
**File**: `packages/http-proxy/src/proxy-server.ts`
**Changes**: Implement main proxy server class

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create ProxyServer class with configurable local port and target host/port
- Implement request forwarding logic using fetch API (Bun-native)
- Add proper error handling for connection failures, timeouts, and invalid responses
- Include request/response logging capabilities
- Support both HTTP and HTTPS target servers
- Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Preserve original request headers and body content
- Implement graceful server shutdown

#### 2. Configuration Management
**File**: `packages/http-proxy/src/config.ts`
**Changes**: Configuration schema and validation

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Define TypeScript interfaces for proxy configuration
- Support environment variable overrides
- Include defaults for common settings (timeouts, ports)
- Validate target URL format and reachability
- Allow configuration of custom headers to add/remove

#### 3. Message Processing Interface
**File**: `packages/http-proxy/src/message-processor.ts`
**Changes**: Pluggable message processing system

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Define abstract MessageProcessor interface for custom logic
- Create default pass-through processor
- Allow processors to inspect and modify requests before forwarding
- Enable processors to generate custom responses instead of forwarding
- Support async processing operations
- Include context information (original request, target config, etc.)
- Handle processor errors gracefully without crashing proxy

#### 4. Main Entry Point
**File**: `packages/http-proxy/index.ts`
**Changes**: Package entry point and CLI interface

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Export main ProxyServer class and interfaces
- Create simple CLI for standalone usage
- Support configuration via command line arguments
- Include help text and usage examples
- Handle process signals for graceful shutdown
- Provide programmatic API for embedding in other applications

### Success Criteria:

**Automated Verification:**
- [ ] `bun test` passes all unit tests

**Manual Verification:**
- [ ] Proxy server starts and listens on configured port
- [ ] HTTP requests are successfully forwarded to target server
- [ ] Response bodies and headers are correctly returned to client
- [ ] Error handling works for unreachable target servers
- [ ] Graceful shutdown works via SIGTERM/SIGINT signals


## Phase 2: Advanced Message Processing

### Overview
Implement the pluggable message processing system that allows custom logic to intercept, modify, or replace request handling.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Processor Registry
**File**: `packages/http-proxy/src/processor-registry.ts`
**Changes**: System for managing multiple processors

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create registry for registering multiple message processors
- Support processor chaining and ordering
- Allow conditional processor application based on request properties
- Include built-in processors for common use cases (logging, header modification)
- Enable runtime processor registration and removal
- Handle processor execution failures gracefully

#### 2. Built-in Processors
**File**: `packages/http-proxy/src/processors/`
**Changes**: Common processor implementations

**Implementation Requirements:**
- LoggingProcessor: Log all requests and responses with configurable detail levels
- HeaderProcessor: Add, remove, or modify request/response headers
- BodyProcessor: Inspect and potentially modify request/response bodies
- RouteProcessor: Route requests to different targets based on path/headers
- ResponseProcessor: Generate custom responses for specific request patterns
- Each processor should be self-contained and testable

#### 3. Configuration Integration
**File**: `packages/http-proxy/src/config.ts`
**Changes**: Extend configuration to support processors

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Add processor configuration section to main config schema
- Support enabling/disabling processors via configuration
- Allow processor-specific configuration options
- Include validation for processor configuration
- Support loading processor configurations from files
- Enable environment-based processor configuration

#### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
**File**: `packages/http-proxy/src/error-handler.ts`
**Changes**: Comprehensive error handling system

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create structured error types for different failure modes
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Add circuit breaker pattern for repeatedly failing targets
- Include health check endpoint for monitoring proxy status
- Log errors with appropriate detail levels
- Generate meaningful error responses for clients

### Success Criteria:

**Automated Verification:**
- [ ] `bun run typecheck` passes with no errors
- [ ] `bun test` passes all processor and integration tests
- [ ] Processor registry tests verify correct chaining and error handling

**Manual Verification:**
- [ ] Custom processors can be registered and execute correctly
- [ ] Processor chaining works with multiple processors
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages processor failures
- [ ] Built-in processors work as expected (logging, header modification)
- [ ] Configuration system properly configures processors

## Phase 3: Testing and Documentation

### Overview
Complete the implementation with comprehensive testing, example processors, and usage documentation.

### Changes Required:

## Migration Notes

Not applicable - this is a new package with no existing data or systems to migrate.

## References

**IMPORTANT**: all reques/responses should be logged in the following format:

```
<METHOD> <PATH?QUERY>
    <BODY>
```

e.g. 
```
POST /api/test/1234
    {
        "test": 123
    }
DELETE /api/test2
    {
        "othertest": 12345
    }
```
